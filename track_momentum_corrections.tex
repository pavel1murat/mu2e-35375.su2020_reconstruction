\section{Track momentum corrections}

The mean value of the reconstructed track momentum extrapolated to the tracker entrance is
slightly lower than the true MC momentum of the corresponding MC particle {\blue at the tracker entrance}.
The offset is \strike{of} {\blue on} the order of 30 keV/c and slightly \strike{different} 
{\blue depends on the ambiguity resolver used in the track fit.}
\strike{the track fits with different ambiguity resolvers.}
We correct the reconstructed \strike{momenta} {\blue momentum} of PAR tracks by 34 keV/c \strike{keV/c ,}
{\blue keV/c} and DAR tracks \strike{-} by 30 keV/c.
