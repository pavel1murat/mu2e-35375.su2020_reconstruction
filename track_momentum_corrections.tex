\section{Track momentum corrections}

The mean value of the reconstructed track momentum extrapolated to the tracker entrance is
slightly lower than the true MC momentum of the corresponding MC particle.
The offset is of the order of 30 keV/c and slightly different the track fits with different
ambiguity resolvers. 
We correct the reconstructed momenta of PAR tracks by 34 keV/c , and DAR tracks - by 30 keV/c.

  \label{fig:sindrum_ii_fig_08_fit} 
  $\Delta P$ distributions at the tracker front for PAR (left) and DAR (right) tracks. The distributions  
  are fit with the asymmetric ($\sigma_{left} \ne \sigma_{right}$) gaussian function. Peak positions are used
  to correct the reconstructed  momenta of the tracks coming of the respective fits.
