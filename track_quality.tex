\section{Track momentum corrections}

The mean value of the reconstructed track momentum extrapolated to the tracker entrance is
slightly lower than the true MC momentum of the corresponding MC particle.
The offset is of the order of 30 keV/c and slightly different the track fits with different
ambiguity resolvers.
We correct the reconstructed momenta of PAR tracks by 34 keV/c , and DAR tracks - by 30 keV/c.

\section{Track Selections}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$\mu^- \rightarrow e^-$ Channel}


Selection of correctly reconstructed tracks plays a critical role in the search.
In the Mu2e offline, there are two track fitters which correspond to two different
hit ambiguity resolvers. An ANN-based training has been performed only for one of them,
so-called ``panel-based ambiguity resolver''.

We performed a similar training for the output of the track fits using the doublet-based
ambiguity resolver.

Following \cite{MU2E_4595_ANN_TRAINING}, we used ROOT TMVA package to train a MLP ANN
with 8 input variables and one hidden layer. The following eight variables were used as inputs:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {\bf na }: number of ``active'' hits remaining on the track after the Kalman fit
\item
  {\bf  nafract} = na/nhits , ratio of the number of active hits to the total number of hits
  (after the seed fit)
\item
  $log_{10}{fcons}$ : {\bf fcons}, or fit consistency is a probability-minded derivative
  from the track fit $\chi^2$. Logarithm of it it taken from the numerical considerations
\item
  {\bf momerr}: uncertainty on the reconstructed track momentum, returned by the fitter
\item
  {\bf t0err} : uncertainty on the reconstructed track time, T0, returned by the fitter
\item
  {\bf fda} : = Nd/Na, fraction of ``doublet'' active hits
\item
  {\bf fza } : = Nza/Na, fraction of activev hits with undefined drift direction
\item
  {\bf fma } : {\bf \red to be clarified}
\end{itemize}

Training was aimed to optimize separation of electron tracks reconstructed correctly, 
with $\Delta{P} = |P_{reco}-P_{true}| < 0.25$ MeV/c, or with momenta reconstructed approximately
within $2\sigma$ from the true value, from tracks reconstructed
with $\Delta{P} > 0.7$ MeV/c, or , approximately, $5\sigma$ above the true value.

Comparison between $P_{true}$ and $P_{reco}$ was performed in a  plane corresponding to the tracker front.

Tracks used for the ANN training were required to have |D0| < 100 mm and 0.5 < \tandip < 1 is. 

To choose between the PAR-based and DAR-based fitters, we compared performance of the
trained DAR ANN to the performance of the PAR ANN.

The results are shown in Figure ..... .
Using the CD3 choice of the signal region , 103.85 < p < 104.90 MeV/c, we compared the
CE reconstruction efficiency of the two methods vs the expected DIO background.

Figure \ref{fig:mumem_trq_ann_signal_vs_background} shows the result.

Use of the DAR track fits allows to increase acceptance by 4-5\%, while keeping the expected
background below the level corresponding to PAR fits.

The operational point corresponds to the cut on the output of DAR ANN $S_{DAR} > 0.2$.

Improvements in the track reconstruction resulted in a significantly better separation between the two classes of tracks.
Shown in Figure \ref{fig:dio_delta_p_1036_1050} is the $\Delta{P}$ distribution for the simulated DIO electrons.
with momenta reconstructed in the region [103.6, 105.0] MeV/c.
Fraction of tracks with significantly mis-reconstructed momenta, $\Delta{P} > 0.5$ MeV, is about 0.23.
about 50\% lower than 0.355, estimated in the same momentum window in \cite{MU2E_4595_ANN_TRAINING}..

As a cross-check, we trained a BDT-based TMVA classifier. Similar to \cite{MU2E_33150_ANN_TRAINING},
we found that the ANN performed slightly better, so current analysis uses an ANN-based track
quality selection.

To explore the parameter space, a similar ANN has been trained to discriminate the tracks reconstructed
with $\Delta{P} < 0.25$ MeV/c from tracks with $\Delta{P} > 0.6$ MeV/c. No improvement in the DIO
suppression in the region [103.85, 104.9] MeV/c was observed. 

Continuing the phase space exploration, we trained an similar ANN with the bato discriminate the tracks for
$\Delta{P} < 0.25$ MeV/c from tracks with $\Delta{P} > 0.6$ MeV/c. No improvement in the DIO
suppression in the region [103.85, 104.9] MeV/c was observed.

background definition: number of events with $\Delta{P} > 1$ MeV/c.
Interestingly, that with this background definition, background increases exponentially with the acceptance, 
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mumep_trq_ann}

Cut $S_{DAR} > 0.2$ improves the signal acceptance by 10\%, while increasing the background by 15\%.
Relaxing the cut to $S_{DAR} > 0.15$ adds another 2\% to the CP acceptance, while the background grows 
much faster and becomes $B_{ANN}/N_{ANN}^{default} = 1.5,$

We tried to train an ANN for PAR tracks, somewhat surprisingly, its performance

\subsection{Testing Charge symmetry of the ANN-based track selections}

ANN training doesn't include variables which explicitly depend on the track charge, 

Figure \ref{fig:su2020_mva_test_dar} compares performance of the ANN trained using 
negative tracks, for e+ of the same energy.

ANN selection is charge-symmetric with an accuracy better than 0.5\%, using AMN trained on 
92 MeV signal and cutting at the same value reduces efficiency by less than 4\%.

\subsection{Final track quality selections}

The finalized track selection includes three cuts. The track impact parameter cut selects tracks consistent 
with coming from the stopping target, the track $\tan\lambda$ cut, in essense, is an anti-cosmics cut, and 
its final value needs to be optimized. The cut on the ANN output, or score, variable selects
well reconstucted tracks.
