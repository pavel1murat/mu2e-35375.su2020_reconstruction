\section{Track momentum corrections}

The mean value of the reconstructed track momentum extrapolated to the tracker entrance is
slightly lower than the true MC momentum of the corresponding MC particle.
The offset is of the order of 30 keV/c and slightly different the track fits with different
ambiguity resolvers.
We correct the reconstructed momenta of PAR tracks by 34 keV/c , and DAR tracks - by 30 keV/c.

\section{Track Selections}

Selection of correctly reconstructed tracks plays a critical role in the search.
In the Mu2e offline, there are two track fitters which correspond to two different
hit ambiguity resolvers. An ANN-based training has been performed only for one of them,
so-called ``panel-based ambiguity resolver''.

We performed a similar training for the output of the track fits using the doublet-based
ambiguity resolver.

Following \cite{MU2E_4595_ANN_TRAINING}, we used ROOT TMVA package to train a MLP ANN
with 8 input variables and one hidden layer. The following variables were used as inputs:

.....

The goal of training was to optimize separation of the electron tracks reconstructed correctly,
with $\Delta{P} = |P_{reco}-P_{true}| < 0.25$ MeV/c, or approximately $2\sigma$, from tracks
reconstructed with $\Delta{P} > 0.7$ MeV/c, or , approximately, $5\sigma$ above the true value.
The comparison between the $P_{true}$ and $P_{reco}$ was performed in a plane corresponding to
the tracker entrance. 

The acceptance cut |D0| < 100 mm require selected track to be consistent with coming
from the stopping target.

Cut on the track dip angle 0.5 < tan(dip) < 1 is, in essence, an anti-cosmic cut which
needs to be optimized.

As a cross-check, we also trained a BDT-based TMVA classifier. Similar to \cite{MU2E_33150_ANN_TRAINING},
we found that the ANN performed slightly better, so current analysis uses an ANN-based track
quality selection.

Improvements in the track reconstruction resulted in a significantly better separation
between the two classes of tracks. For example, the expected relative contribution of
the DIO tracks with $\Delta{P} > 0.5$ MeV inthe ``signal'' region, [103.6,105.0] MeV/s was
found to be 0.228. This number is 50\% lower than 0.355, estimated in \cite{MU2E_4595_ANN_TRAINING}
for the same region.

  77.2\% of reconstructed events in this region are expected to have $\Delta P < 0.5$ MeV/c
}
\end{figure}

To explore the parameter space, we also trained a similar ANN to discriminate the tracks for
$\Delta{P} < 0.25$ MeV/c from tracks with $\Delta{P} > 0.6$ MeV/c. No improvement in the DIO
suppression in the region [103.85, 104.9] MeV/c was observed. 

To choose between the PAR-based and DAR-based fitters, we compared performance of the
trained DAR ANN to the performance of the PAR ANN.

The results are shown in Figure ..... .
Using the CD3 choice of the signal region , 103.85 < p < 104.90 MeV/c, we compared the
CE reconstruction efficiency of the two methods vs the expected DIO background.

Figure \ref{fig:ann_operational_point_choice} shows the result.

Use of the DAR track fits allows to increase acceptance by 4-5\%, while keeping the expected
background below the level corresponding to PAR fits.

The operational point corresponds to the cut on the output of DAR ANN $S_{DAR} > 0.2$.

Figure \ref{fig:dar_vs_par_ann} compares distributions of the track momentum resolution for DAR ANN-based track
selections and PAR ANN-based track selection. For the PAR fit, the track selection corresponding to For DAR fits, 
we show two operational points corresponding to the same efficiency and the same expected DIO background.

\subsection{Final track quality selections}

Final track selection includes three cuts. The track impact parameter cut selects tracks consistent 
with coming from the stopping target, the track $\tan\lambda$ cut, in essense, is an anti-cosmics cut, and 
its final value needs to be optimized. The cut on the ANN scose selects well reconstucted tracks.
