\section{Tuning the calorimeter timing resolution}

The calorimeter timing has been tuned as shown in Figure \ref{fig:calorimeter_timing_resolution_2batch}.

The resolution tuning has been performed after the global track-to-calorimeter timing offsets
have been corrected. The global correction introduced was 1.86ns, while after the tuning, the offset
value is about 1.6 ns. Resulting non-accounted for systematic offset of about 0.25 ns is however
about x2 smaller than the offset introduced by the Kalman fitter.
