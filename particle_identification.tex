Datasets used for MVA training : {\bf ele00s61b0} and {\bf mumi0s61b0}


\subsection {Event selection}

After the reconstructed calorimeter cluster is included into the track fit, it biases the fit results.

Something ( a bug?) in the track fit pulls the track timing to the cluster and biases
the reconstructed track timing.

There  is a correlation between the cluster timing residual and the reconstructed Z-coordinate of the
``calorimeter cluster hit'', which the fitter varies in order to minimize the timing residual.

As inclusion of the cluster into the track fit stabilizes the fit and improves its efficiency,
we use track fits with the calorimeter cluster included.

\subsection {Training}

MVA classifiers were trained only for DAR resolver, however based on the nature of 
the variables used, we expect the trained MVA to perform equally well for PAR tracks.

Although both electron and muon reconstruction were ran on the same event, the MVA training used inputs 
only fotm electron reconstruction. Adding requirement for a track to be reconstructed under muon hypothesis 
complicates logic, reduces overall efficiency without providing a visible improvement.

For training: events which have a track reconstructed under DEM\_DAR hypothesis and passing the track 
selection cuts described in 

Variables and their ranking:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  E(cluster)/P(track) : to reduce explicit dependence on the track momentum 
\item 
  number of crystals in the calorimeter cluster
\item 
  eSeedfr: fraction of energy in the seed crystal
\item 
  $\Delta T$ : time residual of the calorimeter cluster as determined by the kalman fit
\item 
  $Cluster Z$ : cluster Z-coordinate (within the corresponding calorimeter disk) as determined by the kalman fit
\item 
  $\Delta R$ : radial residual of the calorimeter cluster as determined by the kalman fit
\item 
  {\bf path} : overall length of the trajectory within the calorimeter disk, defines edges
\end{itemize}

We didn't consider pathological cases with muons passing electron reconstruction, but failing
the muon one, and assume the probability of that to be negligibly small.

Training preselection cuts:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  reject muon decays in flight: require muon Zmax > 10000,
\item 
  reconstructed track passed electron track selection
\item 
  an event has a reconstructed cluster 
\item 
  $\Delta T > -100$ : some events with reconstructed tracks and clusters had $\Delta T$ undefined

\end{table}

About 6.5\% of all events with tracks and clusters don't have a good track fit, are rejected.
this needs to be investigated.

for electron events with the reconstructed track momentum $P > 100$ MeV/c, passing the preselections, 
the PID efficiency is 0.993


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
Efficiency for muon events passing the same preselections: 

\begin{itemize}
\item
  $P > 100$                       : 109004
\item 
  $PID >0.5$                      :    799
\end{itemize}

which is about 0.8\%.

Contributing to muon mis-identification are decays of stopped muons with in the calorimeter, early part of the exponential, 
in which the electron energy is counted as the part of the cluster energy
